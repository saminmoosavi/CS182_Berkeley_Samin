    "\n",
    "Language modeling is the task of assigning a probability to sentences in a language. Besides assigning a probability to each sequence of words, the language models also assigns a probability for the likelihood of a given word (or a sequence of words) to follow a sequence of words.\n",
    "— Page 105, __[Neural Network Methods in Natural Language Processing](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Processing-Synthesis-Lectures-Technologies/dp/1627052984/)__, 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of neural network, we are training a neural network to produce probabilities (classification) over a fixed vocabulary of words.\n",
    "Concretely, we are training a neural network to produce:\n",
    "$$ P ( w_{i+1} | w_1, w_2, w_3, ..., w_i), \\forall i \\in (1,n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "** Why is language modeling important? **\n",
    "\n",
    "Language modeling is a core problem in NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models can either be used as a stand-alone to produce new text that matches the distribution of text the model is trained on, but can also be used at the front-end of a more sophisticated model to produce better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently for example, the __[BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)__ paper show-cased that pretraining a large neural network on a language modeling task can help improve state-of-the-art on many NLP tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "How good can the generation of a Language model be?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not seen the post about GPT-2 by OpenAI, you should read some of the samples they generated from their language model __[here](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/#sample1)__.\n",
    "Because of computational restrictions, we will not achieve as good text production, but the same algorithm is at the core. They just use more data and compute."
